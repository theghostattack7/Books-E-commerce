    <h2 class="aboutUsText">Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Books of Life began in 2006 in a small town in Philadelphia with a simple
      but powerful idea: everyone deserves access to books at affordable prices.
      What started as a small local shop built on passion and community has
      grown into an international bookstore serving readers around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      From day one, our mission has been clear — to make quality literature
      accessible without compromising on excellence. Over the years, we’ve
      expanded our selection, improved our services, and built a growing
      community of readers who share our love for stories, knowledge, and
      imagination.

    <h2 class="aboutUsText">Our Belief</h2>
    <p>
      We believe books are the blueprint upon which society is built. Every
      great moment in history, every transformative idea, and every
      unforgettable fictional world lives within their pages. Reading is more
      than a hobby — it’s a gateway to understanding, creativity, and
      connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Books of Life, we believe everyone should have the opportunity to
      experience that.
